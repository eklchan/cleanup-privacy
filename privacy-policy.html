Of course. A privacy policy is a crucial requirement for the Shopify App Store. Based on my understanding of your app's functionality—that it reads and analyzes product data to help merchants clean up their catalog—I've drafted a privacy policy.

This policy clarifies what data your app handles (primarily product data, not customer personal data), how it's used, and how you comply with GDPR requirements. It's written in HTML as you requested.

Here is the code for your `privacy-policy.html` file.

        <h1>Privacy Policy for Smart Cleanup</h1>
        <p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 1, 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Smart Cleanup (the "App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information from merchants ("you") who install and use our Shopify application. Our commitment is to protect your privacy and handle your data in an open and transparent manner.</p>
        <p>By installing and using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To provide our services, we collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merchant Account Information:</strong> When you install the App, we automatically access certain information from your Shopify account, such as your shop domain, contact email, and name. This is used to identify your account, communicate with you, and provide support.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Catalog Data:</strong> The core function of our App is to analyze and help you manage your product catalog. To do this, we access, process, and store data about your products, including titles, descriptions, prices, SKUs, barcodes, inventory levels, images, vendor information, product types, tags, and collection associations.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Information:</strong> We do not intentionally collect, store, or process personally identifiable information (PII) about your customers. Our App's function is centered on product data, not customer data. However, to comply with Shopify's requirements, we have implemented the necessary webhooks to process GDPR data redaction requests for customers and shops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Smart Cleanup service.</li>
            <li>To analyze your product catalog, identify potential issues (e.g., duplicates, missing data), and provide you with the tools to correct them.</li>
            <li>To respond to your questions, comments, and support requests.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations, including responding to GDPR data redaction webhooks as required by Shopify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal or business information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers (e.g., cloud hosting providers) who perform services on our behalf. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and are not authorized to use it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid request by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your product catalog data for as long as the App is installed on your store to provide our services and for historical analysis within your account.</p>
        <p>Upon uninstallation of the App, or upon receiving a valid `shop/redact` request from Shopify, we will initiate a process to securely delete all data associated with your shop from our active systems in a timely manner.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>As a data controller for your store's information, you have certain rights regarding your data. You can access and manage your product data directly through your Shopify admin and our App's interface.</p>
        <p>Uninstalling the App serves as a request to terminate the service and delete your data from our systems.</p>
        <p>We are fully compliant with Shopify's mandatory GDPR webhooks (`customers/redact`, `customers/data_request`, `shop/redact`) to ensure the privacy rights of your customers and your shop are respected.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and, where appropriate, through the Shopify admin interface. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
